        "he seemed to have his attention provoked by high pitched noises, and then would watch for a bit",
        "She seemed more interested in listening than watching. She would watch certain clips for a few seconds, then her head would turn towards the speaker and she would listen, trying to locate the sounds. Noticed this particularly when rodents were running on hard surfaces and made a scratching sound. Birds making noise also captivated her attention.",
        "My cat was most interested in animals moving on and off screen and getting closer and farther away from the camera. She would get startled when something would run quickly across the screen, but in many other scenes I listed in the timestamps, she would put her head down and look away - not seeming engaged with what was on screen...as though nothing was there.",
        "She listened to the video as much as watched it. She pawed at the screen twice, once for the toilet flush and once for a little dog. She responded to the dry food by licking their lips and making eating motions with her mouth. She would have probably been interested in most of but it was just too long for her attention span and she went off to do other things. But shestayed in the vicinity, still listening in, and came back to watch again near the end (kittens being born)",

        "It was tough to judge his reaction to most things as he's never really been interested in watching screens. He was content to just lay there and listen (his eyes were closed some of the time), but nothing really elicited a reaction except sounds he recognizes from inside of our house: toilet flushing (he drinks from it daily), can opening (soft food is his favourite) and the sound of hard food shaking around and spilling in a dish. It wasn't an intense reaction but rather some ear movement that indicated they were familiar sounds to him, but not HIS sounds. He seemed relaxed throughout except for when the dog howling came on. He wasn't scared but it, but seemed annoyed/irritated by the intrusiveness of it all. He jumped off the couch and went to his cat tower as soon as the dog started making noise.",

I honestly can't quite think of a situation where I would put my cat in front of the TV besides an artist like yourself making one -- so that's another thing to think through. nice work, jen! :)",
        "The dog definitely made her interested the most but she thought I was making the sound and was extremely scared during the whining sounds haha! The water, cat food scenes, and static camera view where dogs were running around balls/chasing each other were the big hits. She is indoor so birds or reptiles seemed less exciting.",
        "-More food, especially kibble.\r\n-I don't think he's fooled for more than half a second by 2D representations of reality (or not smart enough to make the leap from abstraction).\r\n-To be fair, this was on a laptop screen.",

Aug really sought to make Casio comfortable, and Casio preferred watching from the couch rather than on our laps.\r\n\r\nBen was surprised by how drawn Casio was. The video of Weiner at the beginning and the turtle eating clearly had her attention. So too the little worried dog. Other parts she would look at, but did not seem as engaged.\r\n\r\nShe would sometimes watch the screen but then sometimes she would expressly look away from  it. \r\n\r\nBen can't think of what might be cut or added."

She got bored right around the same point where I got bored (doggy howling). I stayed interested, though, with the change of scene, and she came back. So maybe its good to think about human attention span too? Chips eating part was boring to me, but the rest of it was not. very asmr",
